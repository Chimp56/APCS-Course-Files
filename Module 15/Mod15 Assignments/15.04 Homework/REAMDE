I remember being a bit confused when I learnt about the compareTo method for strings, as it didn't seem very intuitive
and I could never remember what the output meant. This lesson cleared it up however, and it is cool to see how I can use
the Comparable<t> interface classes I create, it seems like a good way to standardize comparing Objects.

I sometimes still mix up the order between the object calling the compareTo method and the parameter Object, but that will
surely become better as I implement and use the Comparable<t> interface more often. Also, it can get confusing sometimes
implementing multiple interfaces, as if you forget to define an abstract method, the program refuses to run!

This interface seems very useful, and I could see it being helpful when needing to sort large amounts of data by a certain
value. Instead of giving you a fixed way to compare Objects, java allows you to create your own method through the Comparable<t>
interface, which I find very cool and intuitive.

PMR

I liked how this assignment combined everything I had learnt in the previous lessons, it definitely help differentiate
abstract classes and interfaces, and I feel like I have a good understanding of when to use them. I didn't know you could
use an interface in an ArrayList, so that seemed very cool to me!

The directions were a bit vague, so I hope I did everything right. The output seems fine, but I was expecting the assignment
would be bigger, and not just instructions from the pdf.

While I was a bit confused about why Polymorphism and Inheritance were so important when I first learnt about them, now
I see that they go very well with Abstract Classes and Interfaces. It is great to be able to declare an array of one type,
put many different types into it through polymorphism, and even be able to increment through it with a for-each loop!

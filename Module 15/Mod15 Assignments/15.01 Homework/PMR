PMR Hello from SSH!!

Abstract classes seem very cool, and it helps demonstrate again how useful polymorphism is in Java. Also, I uses the
Random class to generate page numbers, just for fun :)

It kind of stinks that you can't access instance variables from the abstract superclass directly, it is a pain having
to use the getter and setter methods.

Overall abstract classes seem like a great way to quickly create many similar classes without having to repeat yourself,
which is always a good thing!

Since we learned about the Caesar cypher at the Module 12 collaboration, it
wasn't anything new really. Making variables like the alphabet final also helps
ensure that there are as few bugs a possible; I have often mixed up variable
names in programs when assigning values, and making a variable final prevents
this from happening.

The alphabet was kind of annoying to type in, and I wasn't exactly sure where
the optimal place would be for the alphabet variable.

Overall the Caesar Cypher program was pretty fun, I will probably use it
sometime whenever I want to send something secret :)

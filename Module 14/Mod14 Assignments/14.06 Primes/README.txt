PMR

+
I have already used prime numbers a lot at this website
https://projecteuler.net/ , so I could just reuse the algorithm I use there,
translated into object oriented form. Prime numbers are one of my favorite
topics, and I was exited when I saw the assignment title!

I'm still a bit confused about when we should be using "this", are we supposed
to use it whenever we mention instance variables or just at the declaration?
Also, I still don't get why Object-Oriented design would be practical for a
problem like this where you won't have multiple objects and static methods would
work just fine.

Morse code was an interesting topic to learn about, and the program works
pretty well! I always preferred static methods to instance methods, although
that may change soon when I really need to process lots of data.

I forgot a lot of the file reading stuff like the "throws execution" and
closing the file after I was finished with it. Java seems really nitpicky when
it comes to file processing.

Overall the Morse code program was fun and challenging to make, and it was cool
to learn a lot of the stuff that was skipped over before like public vs private
and the Integer and Double classes.

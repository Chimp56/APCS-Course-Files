\textbf{Post}: Eve should probably consider posing as a Field Service Manager, as it would give
her an excuse to be directly operating in the field. In addition, the status of
Manager would ensure that she is treated more seriously than the typical CSA
employee. Before 2015, she would have the right to conduct this investigation
under the Patriot Act and could have submitted a request for a warrant to a FISA
court, but the Patriot Act has been repealed now, so she might have to act
under the new USA Freedom act. 

While ``spying'' on people can sometimes yield valuable information, more often
than not it results in false positives and can infringe a person's right to
privacy. There are much better ways to stop crime and terrorism than spying,
such as preventative legislation, punishments, or simply through more careful
security in order to close loopholes that may be exploited.

\textbf{Response (Franziska Leutsch)}: While there is a chance of catching the
criminals using spying, it is certainly not guaranteed. Even though missing a
criminal due to privacy laws can be bad, infringing the rights or even
convicting innocent people is much worse.

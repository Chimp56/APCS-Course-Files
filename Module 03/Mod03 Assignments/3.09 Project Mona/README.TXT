It was fun and challenging to solve the problems given by the assignemnt, and I was very satisfied
after finishing the program!

-
It took me a while to learn to use the delimiter method, so the Scanner would skip the comma in the
Last, First name input. I also had to reset the delimiter afterwards, or else the program would keep 
crashing. 

After completing this program, I feel my knoledge of the Scanner method has really increased, I feel
comfortable moving on to module 4.

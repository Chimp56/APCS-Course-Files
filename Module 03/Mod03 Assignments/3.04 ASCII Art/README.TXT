PMR 

+
ASCII picture was fun and relatively easy to make. 

-
Didn't know that both the \r and \n escape sequences were needed to go to the next line, had to 
Google it. The escape sequences for the \ and " symbols also threw off the formatting of the 
picture in the source code and made it difficult to align, although the display worked fine. 

ASCII Art helped me practice escape sequences and strings.

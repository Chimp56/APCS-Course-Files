Scanner class was easy to use, again with the Java API helping a lot, didn't take too much time
to edit. 

-
Forgot to import the Scanner class at the beginning, had to shift around the order of the program
in order to accept the user input before the rest of the program started. 

The addidtion of user input made these programs much more fun and easy to use, going through the source
code to change input kind of defeated the purpose of these programs.

The catapult program was interesting to make and learn about, and it felt great
to finish the last program of the first semester!

I wasn't exactly sure whether to take an Object-Oriented or Static approach, I decided
to use static methods as I felt like I didn't have the need for multiple objects. It also took
me a while to find out that you needed to use dot notation to call static
methods outside of their class.

This course has been a lot of fun so far, I certainly like it better than my school classes :) I am
excited to move on to the second semester!

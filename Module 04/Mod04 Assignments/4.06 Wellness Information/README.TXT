+
Menu was quick and easy to finish using MathMenu as a reference.

Rubric said to "compare" the strings, does this include using the equals method, or does it mean the 
actual compare method (which I did not use) ?

Menu options seem much more reliable than just entering data directly, as it seems to allow less
room for input error.

I enjoyed making the program, and it helped solidify my understanding
of recursion. I also got a good review of all of the String methods!

I had some trouble with the helper method at first, and my solution with
the ASCII characters seems kind of sloppy. Also, it seems kind of wasteful to
put the helper method in the recursive method; why couldn't it just act on the
user input directly?

The EIMACS activities and the examples in the lessons made recursion really easy
to understand, I had tried learning it a while ago with another programming language,
and it was a mess!

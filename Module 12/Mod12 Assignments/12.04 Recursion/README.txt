Piecewise functions made recursion a lot easier to understand, and it was cool
seeing how such a short program without any loops could achieve so much.

I think I will still need some practice with recursion before being able to apply it to real
life situations, it still seems a little alien.

The piecewise functions were fun to program, and it was a good review from middle school algebra.
I cant wait to learn more about recursion!

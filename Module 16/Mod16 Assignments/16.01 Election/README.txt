This assignment was relatively straightforward and mostly review. It is really
cool how the toString method can be used to print an Object's data when
indirectly invoked from println!

I had to review a lot of old material in order to use the arrays and the printf
command; I haven't had to format printed output in a while!

Algorithms seems like an intimidating topic at first, but it is good to know that they can be as easy as traversals. I am sure they will get harder though...

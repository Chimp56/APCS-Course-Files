This assignment was once again pretty straightforward, and there weren't really
any new concepts, so far algorithms seems to just be a new way of thinking about
what I already know how to do.

Refactoring the the code from using Arrays to ArrayLists took a while, and I had
to change all of the notation in the methods to match it. Also, the new notation
for ArrayLists by declaring them with the List<E> interface is a bit confusing,
and I don't really understand which type to use in method parameters and stuff.

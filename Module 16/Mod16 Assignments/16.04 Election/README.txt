Deleting was again a relatively familiar concept, and it was very easy for
ArrayLists, where we could just use the built-in remove method. In addition, the
EIMACS lesson and the virtual lesson made the process very clear for both arrays
and ArrayLists, so I didn't get confused or make any mistakes.

Deleting from arrays is very tedious and error-prone, and it seems very easy to
forget one step and then generate a Null Pointer Exception or a IndexOutOfBounds
Exception. Also, it is a bit tricky to remember the difference between insertion
and deletion, as they both shift all of the elements in the array, but in
opposite directions.

Insertions were quite easy to grasp, especially with ArrayLists, as they have a
built in method for them. This assignment really helped me grasp the differences
between Arrays and ArrayLists: trying to insert items into arrays often seems
like it would do more harm than good.

Sometimes it gets a bit confusing remembering which way the Array gets
"shifted," and whether an inserted element goes before or after another one when
the second insert method is used.

Insertions would have a lot of practical use when coding, as you might not know
all of the elements in an array right when you initialize it.

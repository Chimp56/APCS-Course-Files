PMR

+
The program was very satisfying to finish, and I ran into a lot less errors and
problems than I did when I was doing the previous assignments. Overall, I feel
pretty confident about Data Structure manipulation, especially with ArrayLists.

-
The program was less of a challenge than it was just writing boilerplate code,
although I guess it is good practice.

This unit was interesting overall, and I am excited to continue the Picture Lab next!

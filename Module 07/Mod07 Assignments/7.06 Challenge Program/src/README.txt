Some of the methods were extremely short, and it was tempting to combine them into one instead of separating them.
Also, the rubric mentioned arrays, but I found no use for them, as it wasn't really necessary to store a large

Module 7 was very interesting to learn about, I cant wait to learn about "objects" in module 8! It is always fun to
solve the challenge programs, as they force you to think and come up with a good solution to the task.

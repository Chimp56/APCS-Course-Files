The math methods were simple to implement, and the Java API provided all of the necessary details. Coincidentally we
were just reviewing the unit circle in Pre-Calculus! Also, I now understand a little more about how methods and
classes work, it was a bit vague in the first 6 modules.

Using words instead of symbols for mathematical operations is a bit weird, I will have to get used to it. I imagine
complex equations will be tricky to decipher with all of the methods instead of square root signs and exponents.

Being able to use classes as templates for other classes is really cool, it
really takes Object-Oriented Programming to the next level. Also, not having to
retype instance variables and methods makes coding similar classes really easy
and quick.

The "super" notation in the class constructor is a bit weird, and it will be
hard to remember to put it in front of all the other instance variables.

Extending classes seems very interesting so far, I can't wait to learn more!

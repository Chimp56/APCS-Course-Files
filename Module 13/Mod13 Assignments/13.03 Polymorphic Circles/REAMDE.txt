While polymorphism seems a bit more complicated than the last few lessons, it
still isn't that bad overall. Using ArrayLists are great, as they deal
excellently with objects, and the program was simple to make.

I don't see any advantages to using this "manual" polymorphism to inheritance,
why do we need to access methods of a superclass when they are automatically
inherited to the subclasses anyway?

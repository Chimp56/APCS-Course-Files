The program was simple to make, and it helped me become more familiar with methods. The EIMACS lessons were
really helpful, and the interactive examples helped a lot with understanding how methods work. It is also cool to
know a little more about the main method, as it always confused me.

I almost forgot how to use the Scanner class and accept input, I hadn't used it in a while. Also, my gravity and weight
data was slightly off, I suppose this is normal though due to rounding and such.

I enjoyed module 7 and learning about methods, I will hopefully talk to you soon for the DBA!

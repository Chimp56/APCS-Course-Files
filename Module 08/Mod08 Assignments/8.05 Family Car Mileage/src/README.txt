I like using parameters for the class much better than using them for individual methods, this way would allow for
much more flexibility, as multiple objects can be created and use the same "template".

I still don't fully understand why the detour to the constructor is necessary, and why two variables are needed to
hold the same data (i.e. data and myData).

This new programming style has really opened my perspective so far, I never expected coding would turn into this
when I was at the beginning of the course!

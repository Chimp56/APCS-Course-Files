Making multiple objects out of the same "template" helps a lot, and prevents lengthy, hard to follow code that uses too
many variables. The analogies given in the lessons helped me understand the material well, and I feel I can now grasp
what Object-Oriented Programming has to offer.

It was still a bit tedious to assign values to each object individually, it would be interesting to use a loop
instead for variable declaration and initialization.

All of the practice in the EIMACS, lessons, and assignments are helping me understand this difficult topic, I am
excited to learn more! It is always cool to learn how to do the same problem in a different, more efficient way.

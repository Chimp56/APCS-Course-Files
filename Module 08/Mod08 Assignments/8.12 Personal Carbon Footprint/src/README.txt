This project was quite fun, I loved how it tied together everything I learnt in the module! It felt great recycling old
code instead of writing it myself, and I can now see how powerful object-oriented programming really is.

There were a ton of instance variables, methods, and getters to keep track of, so it became a bit confusing. Also, it was
kind of a pain to write the code three times: in the class diagram, pseudocode, and actual program. I havn't done a project
yet where planning ahead has saved me time, but it might be coming up in the future!

Module 8 was probably the most challenging module so far, but it was definitely worth it. Objects are extremely powerful and
flexible tools, and I look forward to using them more in the future!

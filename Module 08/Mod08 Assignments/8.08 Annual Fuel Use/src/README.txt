Using each fill-up as a separate object helped a lot with the organization of the code. Also, dividing up the task into
two classes made the program much easier to read and debug, as I could fix incorrect printing and wrong
results independently.

While I used Object-Oriented methods for this assignment, I feel like static methods would have been a better
choice, as I needed to process arrays of objects instead of individual objects, and it didn't seem fair calling the
method on a particular object in the array, when I actually needed to process the whole array, and didn't even need the
instance variables. Hopefully you understand what I mean :)

This program took a while, and it felt great after I finished it! I think switching to Object-Oriented Programming has
the biggest paradigm shift since the course began, and I am really liking it so far!

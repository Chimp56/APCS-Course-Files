Program was relatively quick to create, and it was very sattisfying and fun to solve a problem like this
without getting told exactly how to do it. Learnt a lot abot the random number method. 

-
The algorithm that I originally used had no way to create the largest number of the range, as the random 
method does not create a "1.0". Because of this, I had to add 1 to the range maximum, took me a while to 
solve that issue. 

This program helped me with solidify my understanding of While loops and the random method, they are both
very powerful tools

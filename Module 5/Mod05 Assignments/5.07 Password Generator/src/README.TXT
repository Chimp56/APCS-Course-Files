PMR

It was interesting to think of how to design an efficient solution, I am getting better at "algorithmic
thinking". I have also gained more familiarity with the logical operators, although the many conditions 
caused more room for error and bugs to pop up.

No major problems, although there were a few minor logical errors. 

I can tell I will have trouble hand-writing code for the AP exam, as I won't be able to run it every 
few lines to check for errors. I tries as practice to run it in my head before compiling it this time, but
I still didn't catch a lot of the errors. Hopefully this will come with practice!

On a side note, when are we supposed to order the AP exam? Is this done through my school automatically, 
or do I have to do something?

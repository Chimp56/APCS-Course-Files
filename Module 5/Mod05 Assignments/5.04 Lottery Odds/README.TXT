The for loop was easy to use, and saved a few lines of typing over the while loop. After the last 
assignment, I am also very familiar now with manipulating random numbers.

The EIMACS test as part of the lesson was mostly arrays, so I couldn't do most of it. Other than that, 
this lesson was pretty straightforward. 

For loops seem like a useful and quick tool for counting, even though while loops can do the same thing. 
I will definitely use them in my future programs.

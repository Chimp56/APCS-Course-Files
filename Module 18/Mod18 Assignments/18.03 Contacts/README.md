PMR

The challenge program was a great review of both searching and sorting, and it
was very satisfying to finish it. Overall I feel pretty good about this unit,
and I am ready for the Challenge Exam!

The program took a long time to complete, and I had quite a few bugs along the
way. I also kind of regretted using the merge sort for the binary search, as it
is definitely the most complex and tedious sort algorithm, while being slightly
more efficient than the others. If I could redo the assignment I probably would
have chosen the more simple selection sort or insertion sort.

The concept of binary searching is very cool, and divide and conquer algorithms
always seem very impressive in terms of efficiency. While the program doesn't
actually search the array manually like the sequential search did, it still ends
up with the correct result in the end.

It took me a while to understand how the code worked, and while I understood the
concept as a whole, its implementation was a little bit confusing.

This module was extremely helpful and useful overall, and I will definitely find
use for these algorithms in the future!

The sequential search seems like the most easily recognizable of all of the
search algorithms, and I already knew how to implement it instinctively before
reading the lesson and the labs. The program was interesting to make overall,
and it was fun coming up with a good way to hit multiple search results.

This method seems very inefficient, and does not seem like it would be very
useful in real world situations.

Searching, just like sorting, seems like a very useful skill to have in
programming, and I am looking forward to learning more about it!

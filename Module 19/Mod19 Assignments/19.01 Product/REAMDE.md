While this program was slightly harder than the previous one, it was still
pretty easy, and I didn't have very much trouble with it.

Some of the directions were not very clear, and I had a bit of trouble
understanding what to do in the main class. It was kind of fun however making
the program without being told exactly what to do or how to do it.

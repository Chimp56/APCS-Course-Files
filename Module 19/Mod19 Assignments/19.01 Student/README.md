Assertions seemed like a relatively simple concept, and the assignment was not
very difficult or time consuming. Also, I always wondered how exceptions works,
I never knew they were actually objects that you could "throw" manually!

I don't exactly see how this would be very helpful, as even if you don't
manually account for exceptions, java will generally throw one itself if the
code cannot run.

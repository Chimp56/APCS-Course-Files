I was able to write print commands much faster than my first Hello World assignment.
Starting to get the hang of Blue J Interface and Java, much different than Javascript which I am used to.

Replacing all of the values with variables, and rewriting one print command into two was very
time consuming, even with my use of the find (ctrl-f) and replace commands. 
Also made some minor errors that were a pain to find, such as forgetting a plus sign between parts. 

I guess the benefits of using variables outweigh the costs, as it is easier to change an existing program, 
although it will be difficult to get into the habit of using them instead.

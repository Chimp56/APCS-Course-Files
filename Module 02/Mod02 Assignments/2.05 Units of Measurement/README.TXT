+
Getting much better at using variables instead of values.
Making less errors when typing, can also type faster without too many typing mistakes. 

-
Can be difficult to get spacing correct with the quoted text and the variables that 
are directy being printed, have to use lots of spacing inside quotes. 

I feel like I am getting much better at java, though I am sure the course will become more diffiult
quickly.

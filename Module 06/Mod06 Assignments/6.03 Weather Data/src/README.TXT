The for-each loops were helpful in reducing the amount of code needed to cycle through arrays. Heat
Index was interesting to learn about, and the table wwas easy to format using the new printf method

so it was harder to navigate through the code template given. 

This assignment really helped me learn how to process array data, and how to use for-each loops. Hopefully
plitting the code up into seperate methods, as hinted by the lesson, will help with the readability
in the future.

Project was fun to make, and it was good practice choosing when to use each type of loop, and how to use the arrays.
I also added a tropical storm variable, just in case the the file accidentally had a wind speed bellow that of a
hurricane.

The program involved a ton of variables and a lot of long conditional statements. Is there any way to make my code
shorter and more efficient, or is this the only way?

The challenge program was great review for the upcoming test, and it really helped solidify my understanding of this
first part of the course.

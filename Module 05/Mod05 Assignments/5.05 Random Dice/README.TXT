Unscrambbling the code was much less tedious then writing it all, I learnt a lot about the Random class, 
and it seems a lot more versatile than the Math class and random method.

Still need a bit of practice on nested loops, sometimes I can't wrap my head around what executes first
or last, or how the conditional sequence goes. Also, the rubric mentioned I had to answer "Questions" in 
the PMR, where are they? 

After this assignment, I feel comfortable with for loops, and I am excited to move on further!

+
Using files instead of user input makes it a lot easier to process large amounts of data, and the syntax 
for using them isn't too complicated. 

-
Had some problems initially with the program, as I had the text files open while running them. Also, 
I forgot at first to cast one of the two integers when dividing them to get the percentage, so they kept
giving me 0 every time. 

The application of these text files into coding will surely make it easier for the user, as they can just 
copy/paste info instead of typing it in with many prompts.

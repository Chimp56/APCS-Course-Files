The population ratio program was very similiar to that of a weighted coin, it was interesting to see
how the results got very close to the ratio at high sample sizes, while at low sample sizes randomness
had more of an effect.

Definitely the most time consuming assignment so far, doings all of the trials and putting the data in the
chart was quite time consuming. 

This program definitely taught me a lot, I still need to practice the condition inside of the loop, and 
when to use < or <=, and things like that.

PMR

The challenge program was very helpful, as I got to review all of the algorithms
I learned in the chapter in one program. While it took quite a while to write,
it was definitely satisfying to finish, and it was good practice for a potential
problem like this on the AP Exam.

While we were allowed to choose which algorithms to use on this assignment,
there doesn't seem to be clear guidelines on when to use each algorithm. The
merge sort one seems the most efficient, so I don't see why I would use anything
else since it does not really have any drawbacks.

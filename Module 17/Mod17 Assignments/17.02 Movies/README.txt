This algorithm seems a lot more efficient than the Bubble Sort, and I already
use it instinctively when sorting stuff in the real world, so it was easy to
grasp. The EIMACS lab and the step-by-step code running tool helped me
understand each part of the algorithm, so I know how it works pretty well.

It might be hard to remember this during the AP exam, especially if they ask to
write it from scratch. Also, the code has many moving parts, which leaves a lot
of potential for logic errors if you use the wrong inequality, or don't shift
the elements properly.

I enjoyed learning about the insertion sort overall, and it will surely be
helpful whenever I need to sort an array in a program, which seems like a
relatively common task.

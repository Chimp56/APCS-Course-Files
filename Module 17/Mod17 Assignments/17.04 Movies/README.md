The merge method was fun to learn about and implement, and just like with any
recursive program, it is always impressive to see how the method can do so much
without too much direct action. In addition, it was cool to see how fast this
method was in comparison to the previous insertion and selection sorts, I never
new that two algorithms could be so vastly different in efficiency when they
complete the same task.

The code was pretty complicated, especially for the merge method, and I still
don't understand some of the logic behind it. While I feel like I could
recognize a Merge Sort algorithm for a multiple choice question, I don't think I
could Waite one from scratch without reference.

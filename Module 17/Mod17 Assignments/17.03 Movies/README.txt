The selection sort was pretty similar to the insertion sort, since they both use
nested loops to compare elements and narrow down the size of the array to be
sorted. I think I prefer the insertion, as it is more clear since it uses a
separate destination array, and it can achieve linear time if the array fed to
it is already sorted.

Again, remembering this algorithm and not mixing it up with the others will be
tricky, and implementing the algorithm is often very tedious, even though a lot
of the code can be copied directly from the lesson.

Array lists seem waite similar to arrays in terms of processing objects, the main difference is how each new object
is added to the array. The template we were given at the beginning also helped, as I didn't have to format the table
by hand.

I am still a bit confused about when to make classes and constructors public. In many of the examples we were given,
some of the classes and constructors didn't have public, but in my last assignment you said to add them. Should I
just make all classes and constrictors public then?

It was very interesting learning about how our actions impact the environment, and it was cool to see our carbon emissions
changed based on different factors. I am looking forward to the challenge program!

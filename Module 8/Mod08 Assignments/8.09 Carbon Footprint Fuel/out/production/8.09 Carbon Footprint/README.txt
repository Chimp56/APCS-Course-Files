The javadocs were easy to use, and it was really cool how they enabled my own class to get its own API entry! They also
seemed to help provide comments, so it killed two birds with one stone!

Formatting the data at the end takes the longest amount of time, the formatting table seems slightly off, so I have to
resort to a lot of guessing and checking.

The javadocs seem like a valuable tool for documenting anc commenting on code, I will be sure to use them in future
programs!

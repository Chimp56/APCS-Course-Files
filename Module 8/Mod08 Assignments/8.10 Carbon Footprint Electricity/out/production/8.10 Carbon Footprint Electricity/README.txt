Arrays lists seem very useful, I always thought arrays were a little inflexible, and these are an excellent alternative.
This program wasn't very complicated, and the documentation was easy to make and implement.

The lesson mentions the term "data structure" a lot, and I still don't fully understand what it means. Also, the
<> notation for the ArrayLists is much different than anything I have used in the past, it will take a while to get
used to it.

While ArrayLists can only be used by objects, I thing the advantages and flexibility of using them outweighs the
simplicity of the normal array.

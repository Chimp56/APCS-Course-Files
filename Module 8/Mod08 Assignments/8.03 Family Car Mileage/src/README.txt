I am now starting to see the benefits of object-oriented programming, it allows for an actual object to be represented
and have calculations made on it in code. Creating the objects was familiar after using the same notation earlier in the
course for the Scanner and PrintWriter classes.

I still don't fully understand what the default constructor represents, and why it is necessary. Also, it might be a
bit difficult to record three fill-ups by the time I need them, we don't really fill up the family car more than once
twice a week.

I can't wait to learn more about Object-Oriented Programming! I also liked the class diagrams, they seem a lot more
useful than "normal" pseudocode.

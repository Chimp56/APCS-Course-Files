It was easy to replace the message with abbreviations with the replace method, and the Java API was
easy to navigate and use. 

-
Not exactly sure whether to use single or double quotes (" " or ' ') when using single characters, 
either way seems to work in many cases. 

The Java API is amazing!, I can see it helping a ton in future programs I make, its layout is intuitive
and much better than the API databases of some other languages I have seen.

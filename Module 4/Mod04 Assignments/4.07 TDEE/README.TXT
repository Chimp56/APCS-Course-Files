Menu was familiar to make, the and operator allowed greater flexibility of if and else-if, and the or 
operator allowed me to create less conditional statements, but with more possible conditions in a 
single statement.

This program still required a large number of statements to work, wondering if there is a shorter way. 
Also, I forgot to intialize the Activity Factor variable to 0, this was a problem as the else
statement bypassed assigning a value to the Activity Factor, which created an error when it was used. 

Module 4 was really useful, allowing much more options and flexibility in a single program. I am 
ready for module 5!

If else syntax easy to follow, these conditional commands were almost the exact same in Javascript,
so they came easier. formula was less complex than the BMR one.

You can't use the ^ symbol in java for exponents, so I had to multiply them manually. Also, you can't
put 2<x<4 in a conditional statement, it can only have one symbol. 

I feel comfortable with conditional statements now, hopefully I will get to know when to use each one 
(single if, if-else, and if-else-if)
